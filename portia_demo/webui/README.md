# SQL Demo React UI

This React application provides a user interface for interacting with the SQL database and demonstrations from the SQL demo.

## Features

- **Dashboard**: Overview of database statistics and information
- **Customer List**: View, add, and manage customer data
- **Query Builder**: Write and execute SQL queries with a history panel
- **AI Assistant**: Simulated AI interaction for SQL queries and database help

## Technology Stack

- React 18+
- React Router for navigation
- React Bootstrap for UI components
- Axios for future API integration

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

## Integration with the Backend

Currently, the application simulates data interactions. In a real-world scenario, these components would connect to:

1. A backend REST API for database operations
2. The Portia AI service for AI assistant functionality

## Future Development

- Connect to real backend services
- Add authentication
- Implement more advanced SQL features
- Add visualization of query results
- Create real-time data updates

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
